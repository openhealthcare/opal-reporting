## Introduction: What Is A Report?

A report is a cut of data from an Opal application. The reports are downloaded as a zipped file containing one or more csv files.

## Quickstart Guide

In this section we walk you through creating a simple Report.

Pip install opal-reporting from github and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS

Create a report object in your {{ application }}/reports.py. This should look something like the below...

```python
class YourFirstReport(Report):
    slug = "your-first-report"
    display_name = "Your First Report"
    description = """Everyone has to have one report that is their first, this ones yours"""

    def generate_report_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return [
            ReportFile(
                file_name="some_file.txt", file_data=[['hello']]
            )
        ]
```

Now if you go to "/reporting/#/list" You should see your report listed. Click on this and it should have an option to download your new report.

## Custom Template
Add template to your report, for example

```python
class YourFirstReport(Report):
    slug = "your-first-report"
    display_name = "Your First Report"
    description = """Everyone has to have one report that is their first, this ones yours"""
    template = "my_template"
```

This allows you to put your own template into the front end instead of the default one.
